Deep Learning model to classify Rose and Daisy flowers with web based deployment using Flask
# Tech Stack
* Python
* HTML
* CSS and JavaScript
# Concepts Used
* Convulational Neural Networks
* Flask
* Basic web designing
# Thought behind the Project
* If the model is enhanced to identifiy all kinds of flowers then it can be assisted in exploration of different flowers in the world..
# Steps to run the web app
* Download the repo files as zip and extract them to a folder.
* Download dataset or pre-trained model from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eKytwzJYu-LswnkVU7S-9zx5vYq54MYi?usp=sharing
* Use Rose-Daisy-classification.py to train model(optional instead use the saved model in drive)
* After downloading or training the model put it in the folder with remaining files.
* Run app.py
* A temporary url is displayed copy and paste in browser to open the web app.
* Use images in samples for testing folder to test the app.
* Also find the sample video for reference.
